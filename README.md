# Project Motivation:
<br/>
<br/>
This project is to demonstrate the understanding of data science process and to apply it real data set.<br/>
The data set I chose is provided by AirBNB, the house sharing company for the West Coast City of Seattle,<br/>
Because it is a unique data set that combines business, customer and geographic data.<br/>
I will follow CRISP-DM process in the analysis of this data set.<br/>
<br/>
I will do some data exploration and visualizations to answer the following questions:<br/>
  Q1: Are Customers Happy?<br/>
  Q2: Where listings are concentrated?<br/>  
  Q3: How much the customer is paying to stay in Seattle with AirBNB?<br/>
  Q4: What are the average prices for each neighborhood?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

# Files:

<br/>
The data is divided in three files:<br/>
<br/>
* calendar.csv - containing listing prices and data about availability<br/>
* listings.csv - the main data file, which contains detailed features about each listing<br/>
* reviews.csv - records for listing reviews<br/>
<br/>
The analysis is divided in two files:<br/>
<br/>
* blog_post.ipynb - All the analysis done in this Jupyter Notebook file written in python<br/>
* blog_post.html - HTML report of the Notebook file<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

# Results:

<br/>
All results are in the HTML report (blog_post.html).<br/>
